title: Secure containers with SELinux (Udica)
description: Use Red Hat Enterprise Linux container tools to generate custom SELinux security profiles for a containerized application.
  After completing this scenario, you will be able to run container images and generate SELinux profiles customized
  for your container usecases using Udica

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Query the allow rules in the SELinux policy for the running container
  * Use Udica to generate SELinux security profiles for the container
  * Apply policy modules to the container based on the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) file generated by Udica
  * Re-query the allow rules in the SELinux policy for the running container to ensure that actions are allowed

  # Example Usecase:
  The default container type (container_t) is too restricted for certain usecases. For example, if Apache wants to read the home
  directory, it is restricted by default. Similarly, container_t is too loose for other cases. For example, the Apache running in
  the container can bind to any network port. Using udica can help you write a new SELinux security profiles that are customized for
  your container usecase, and does not require deep SELinux expertise to craft.
